# chalk
Chalk will be a simple css/less framework. I'm heavily relying on skeleton (http://getskeleton.com/) and primer (http://primercss.io/). This is mostly meant as a learning exercise.

In some cases, code or comments may be copied and pasted from other sources. My intention is to cite where everything comes from.
